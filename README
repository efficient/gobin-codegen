Generates code to handle marshaling and unmarshaling to/from 
encoding/binary.

Probably isn't nearly as general as you'd like it to be.
Don't depend on it working properly.  Don't think that it
handles corner cases well.  You get the idea. :)

use:
  export GOPATH=`/bin/pwd`
  go install bi
  bin/bi /path/to/your/go/struct/decl.go > generated_code.go

  use generated_code.go as you see fit.
